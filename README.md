```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'buildkite-test_collector'
end
```

### Step 2

```ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'buildkite/test_collector'
Buildkite::TestCollector.configure(hook: :rspec)
```

Run your tests locally:

```shell
BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN=xyz rspec
```

#### Minitest

Add the following code to your Minitest setup file:

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
require 'buildkite/test_collector'
Buildkite::TestCollector.configure(hook: :minitest)
```

Run your tests locally:

```shell
BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN=xyz rake
```

#### Cucumber

Add the following code to your Cucumber setup file:
